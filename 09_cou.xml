<lb n="09000"/>| <emph>Counterparts</emph>
<lb n="09001"/>| <p>The bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the
<lb n="09002"/>| tube, a furious voice called out in a piercing north of Ireland
<lb n="09003"/>| accent:
<lb n="09004"/>| <said who="">--</said>Send Farrington here!</p>
<lb n="09005"/>| <p>Miss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who
<lb n="09006"/>| was writing at a desk:
<lb n="09007"/>| <said who="">--</said>Mr Alleyne wants you upstairs.</p>
<lb n="09008"/>| <p>The man muttered <emph>Blast him!</emph> under his breath and pushed
<lb n="09009"/>| back his chair to stand up. When he stood up he was tall and of
<lb n="09010"/>| great bulk. He had a hanging face, dark winecoloured, with fair
<lb n="09011"/>| eyebrows and moustache; his eyes bulged forward slightly and
<lb n="09012"/>| the whites of them were dirty. He lifted up the counter and,
<lb n="09013"/>| passing by the clients, went out of the office with a heavy step.</p>
<lb n="09014"/>| <p>He went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing
<lb n="09015"/>| where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription <emph>Mr
<lb n="09016"/>| Alleyne.</emph> Here he halted puffing with labour and vexation and
<lb n="09017"/>| knocked. The shrill voice cried:
<lb n="09018"/>| <said who="">--</said>Come in!</p>
<lb n="09019"/>| <p>The man entered Mr Alleyne's room. Simultaneously Mr
<lb n="09020"/>| Alleyne, a little man wearing goldrimmed glasses on a clean=
<lb n="09021"/>| shaven face, shot his head up over a pile of documents. The
<lb n="09022"/>| head itself was so pink and hairless that it seemed like a large
<lb n="09023"/>| egg reposing on the papers. Mr Alleyne did not lose a moment:
<lb n="09024"/>| <said who="">--</said>Farrington! What is the meaning of this? Why have I always
<lb n="09025"/>| to complain of you? May I ask you why you haven't made a
<lb n="09026"/>| copy of that contract between Bodley and Kirwan? I told you it
<lb n="09027"/>| must be ready by four o'clock.
<lb n="09028"/>| <said who="">--</said>But Mr Shelley said, sir, .....
<lb n="09029"/>| <said who="">--</said><emph>Mr Shelley said, sir.</emph> ..... Kindly attend to what I say and not
<lb n="09030"/>| to what <emph>Mr Shelley says, sir.</emph> You have always some excuse or
<lb n="09031"/>| another for shirking work. Let me tell you that if the contract is
<lb n="09032"/>| not copied before this evening I'll lay the matter before Mr
<lb n="09033"/>| Crosbie ... Do you hear me now?
<lb n="09034"/>| <said who="">--</said>Yes, sir.
<lb n="09035"/>| <said who="">--</said>Do you hear me now? ......... Aye and another little matter! I
<lb n="09036"/>| might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you. Under=
<lb n="09037"/>| stand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch
<lb n="09038"/>| and not an hour and a half. How many courses do you want,
<lb n="09039"/>| I'd like to know? ... Do you mind me, now?
<lb n="09040"/>| <said who="">--</said>Yes, sir.</p>
<lb n="09041"/>| <p>Mr Alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers. The
<lb n="09042"/>| man stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the
<lb n="09043"/>| affairs of Crosbie and Alleyne, gauging its fragility. A spasm of
<lb n="09044"/>| rage gripped his throat for a few moments and then passed,
<lb n="09045"/>| leaving after it a sharp sensation of thirst. The man recognised
<lb n="09046"/>| the sensation and felt that he must have a good night's drink=
<lb n="09047"/>| ing. The middle of the month was past and, if he could get the
<lb n="09048"/>| copy done in time, Mr Alleyne might give him an order on the
<lb n="09049"/>| cashier. He stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile
<lb n="09050"/>| of papers. Suddenly Mr Alleyne began to upset all the papers,
<lb n="09051"/>| searching for something. Then, as if he had been unaware of
<lb n="09052"/>| the man's presence till that moment, he shot up his head again,
<lb n="09053"/>| saying:
<lb n="09054"/>| <said who="">--</said>Eh! Are you going to stand there all the day? Upon my word,
<lb n="09055"/>| Farrington, you take things easy!
<lb n="09056"/>| <said who="">--</said>I was waiting to see. ....
<lb n="09057"/>| <said who="">--</said>Very good, you needn't wait to see. Go downstairs and do
<lb n="09058"/>| your work.</p>
<lb n="09059"/>| <p>The man walked heavily towards the door and as he went
<lb n="09060"/>| out of the room he heard Mr Alleyne cry after him that if the
<lb n="09061"/>| contract was not copied by evening Mr Crosbie would hear of
<lb n="09062"/>| the matter.</p>
<lb n="09063"/>| <p>He returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the
<lb n="09064"/>| sheets which remained to be copied. He took up his pen and
<lb n="09065"/>| dipped it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last
<lb n="09066"/>| words he had written: <emph>In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley
<lb n="09067"/>| be</emph> ...... The evening was falling and in a few minutes they
<lb n="09068"/>| would be lighting the gas: then he could write. He felt that he
<lb n="09069"/>| must slake the thirst in his throat. He stood up from his desk
<lb n="09070"/>| and, lifting the counter as before, passed out of the office. As
<lb n="09071"/>| he was passing out the chief clerk looked at him inquiringly.
<lb n="09072"/>| <said who="">--</said>It's all right, Mr Shelley, said the man pointing with his
<lb n="09073"/>| finger to indicate the objective of his journey.</p>
<lb n="09074"/>| <p>The chief clerk glanced at the hatrack but, seeing the row
<lb n="09075"/>| complete, offered no remark. As soon as he was on the landing
<lb n="09076"/>| the man pulled a shepherd's plaid cap out of his pocket, put it
<lb n="09077"/>| on his head and ran quickly down the rickety stairs. From the
<lb n="09078"/>| street door he walked on furtively on the inner side of the path
<lb n="09079"/>| towards the corner and all at once dived into a doorway. He
<lb n="09080"/>| was now safe in the dark snug of O'Neill's shop and, filling up
<lb n="09081"/>| the little window that looked into the bar with his inflamed
<lb n="09082"/>| face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he called out:
<lb n="09083"/>| <said who="">--</said>Here, Pat, give us a g.p., like a good fellow!</p>
<lb n="09084"/>| <p>The curate brought him a glass of plain porter. The man
<lb n="09085"/>| drank it at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed. He put his
<lb n="09086"/>| penny on the counter and, leaving the curate to grope for it in
<lb n="09087"/>| the gloom, retreated out of the snug as furtively as he had
<lb n="09088"/>| entered it.</p>
<lb n="09089"/>| <p>Darkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the
<lb n="09090"/>| dusk of February and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit.
<lb n="09091"/>| The man went up by the houses until he reached the door of
<lb n="09092"/>| the office, wondering whether he could finish his copy in time.
<lb n="09093"/>| On the stairs a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his
<lb n="09094"/>| nose: evidently Miss Delacour had come while he was out in
<lb n="09095"/>| O'Neill's. He crammed his cap back again into his pocket and
<lb n="09096"/>| reentered the office, assuming an air of absentmindedness.
<lb n="09097"/>| <said who="">--</said>Mr Alleyne has been calling for you, said the chief clerk
<lb n="09098"/>| severely. Where were you?</p>
<lb n="09099"/>| <p>The man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the
<lb n="09100"/>| counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him from
<lb n="09101"/>| answering. As the clients were both male the chief clerk
<lb n="09102"/>| allowed himself a laugh:
<lb n="09103"/>| <said who="">--</said>I know that game, he said. Five times in one day is a little
<lb n="09104"/>| bit ..... Well, you better look sharp and get a copy of our
<lb n="09105"/>| correspondence in the Delacour case for Mr Alleyne.</p>
<lb n="09106"/>| <p>This address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs
<lb n="09107"/>| and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man
<lb n="09108"/>| and, as he sat down at his desk to get what was required, he
<lb n="09109"/>| realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the
<lb n="09110"/>| contract before half past five. The dark damp night was
<lb n="09111"/>| coming and he longed to spend it in the bars, drinking with his
<lb n="09112"/>| friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses. He got
<lb n="09113"/>| out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the office.
<lb n="09114"/>| He hoped Mr Alleyne would not discover that the last two
<lb n="09115"/>| letters were missing.</p>
<lb n="09116"/>| <p>The moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr
<lb n="09117"/>| Alleyne's room. Miss Delacour was a middleaged woman of
<lb n="09118"/>| Jewish appearance. Mr Alleyne was said to be sweet on her or
<lb n="09119"/>| on her money. She came to the office often and stayed a long
<lb n="09120"/>| time when she came. She was sitting beside his desk now in an
<lb n="09121"/>| aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and
<lb n="09122"/>| nodding the great black feather in her hat. Mr Alleyne had
<lb n="09123"/>| swivelled his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot
<lb n="09124"/>| jauntily upon his left knee. The man put the correspondence on
<lb n="09125"/>| the desk and bowed respectfully but neither Mr Alleyne nor
<lb n="09126"/>| Miss Delacour took any notice of his bow. Mr Alleyne tapped
<lb n="09127"/>| a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him
<lb n="09128"/>| as if to say <emph>That's all right: you can go.</emph></p>
<lb n="09129"/>| <p>The man returned to the lower office and sat down again at
<lb n="09130"/>| his desk. He stared intently at the incomplete phrase <emph>In no case
<lb n="09131"/>| shall the said Bernard Bodley be</emph> .... and thought how strange it
<lb n="09132"/>| was that the last three words began with the same letter. The
<lb n="09133"/>| chief clerk began to harry Miss Parker, saying she would never
<lb n="09134"/>| have the letters typed in time for post. The man listened to the
<lb n="09135"/>| clicking of the machine for a few minutes and then set to work
<lb n="09136"/>| to finish his copy. But his head was not clear and his mind
<lb n="09137"/>| wandered away to the glare and rattle of the publichouse. It
<lb n="09138"/>| was a night for hot punches. He struggled on with his copy but
<lb n="09139"/>| when the clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write.
<lb n="09140"/>| Blast it! He couldn't finish it in time. He longed to execrate
<lb n="09141"/>| aloud, to bring his fist down on something violently. He was so
<lb n="09142"/>| enraged that he wrote <emph>Bernard Bernard</emph> instead of <emph>Bernard
<lb n="09143"/>| Bodley</emph> and had to begin again on a clean sheet.</p>
<lb n="09144"/>| <p>He felt strong enough to clear out the whole office single=
<lb n="09145"/>| handed. His body ached to do something, to rush out and revel
<lb n="09146"/>| in violence. All the indignities of his life enraged him. ... Could
<lb n="09147"/>| he ask the cashier privately for an advance? No, the cashier was
<lb n="09148"/>| no good, no damn good: he wouldn't give an advance. ...... He
<lb n="09149"/>| knew where he would meet the boys: Leonard and O'Halloran
<lb n="09150"/>| and Nosey Flynn. The barometer of his emotional nature was
<lb n="09151"/>| set for a spell of riot.</p>
<lb n="09152"/>| <p>His imagination had so abstracted him that his name was
<lb n="09153"/>| called twice before he answered. Mr Alleyne and Miss Dela=
<lb n="09154"/>| cour were standing outside the counter and all the clerks had
<lb n="09155"/>| turned round in anticipation of something. The man got up
<lb n="09156"/>| from his desk. Mr Alleyne began a tirade of abuse, saying that
<lb n="09157"/>| two letters were missing. The man answered that he knew
<lb n="09158"/>| nothing about them, that he had made a faithful copy. The
<lb n="09159"/>| tirade continued: it was so bitter and violent that the man
<lb n="09160"/>| could hardly restrain his fist from descending upon the head of
<lb n="09161"/>| the manikin before him:
<lb n="09162"/>| <said who="">--</said>I know nothing about any other two letters, he said stupidly.
<lb n="09163"/>| <said who="">--</said><emph>You-know-nothing.</emph> Of course you know nothing, said
<lb n="09164"/>| Mr Alleyne. Tell me, he added, glancing first for approval to
<lb n="09165"/>| the lady beside him, do you take me for a fool? Do you think
<lb n="09166"/>| me an utter fool?</p>
<lb n="09167"/>| <p>The man glanced from the lady's face to the little eggshaped
<lb n="09168"/>| head and back again: and almost before he was aware of it his
<lb n="09169"/>| tongue had found a felicitous moment:
<lb n="09170"/>| <said who="">--</said>I don't think, sir, he said, that that's a fair question to put
<lb n="09171"/>| to me.</p>
<lb n="09172"/>| <p>There was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. Every=
<lb n="09173"/>| one was astounded (the author of the witticism no less than his
<lb n="09174"/>| neighbours) and Miss Delacour, who was a stout amiable per=
<lb n="09175"/>| son, began to smile broadly. Mr Alleyne flushed to the hue of a
<lb n="09176"/>| wild rose and his mouth twitched with a dwarf's passion. He
<lb n="09177"/>| shook his fist in the man's face till it seemed to vibrate like the
<lb n="09178"/>| knob of some electric machine:
<lb n="09179"/>| <said who="">--</said>You impertinent ruffian! You impertinent ruffian! I'll make
<lb n="09180"/>| short work of you! Wait till you see! You'll apologise to me for
<lb n="09181"/>| your impertinence or you'll quit the office instanter! You'll quit
<lb n="09182"/>| this, I'm telling you, or you'll apologise to me!</p>
<lb />| *  *  *
<lb n="09183"/>| <p>He stood in a doorway opposite the offices watching to see
<lb n="09184"/>| if the cashier would come out alone. All the clerks passed and
<lb n="09185"/>| finally the cashier came out with the chief clerk. It was no use
<lb n="09186"/>| trying to say a word to him when he was with the chief clerk.
<lb n="09187"/>| The man felt that his position was bad enough. He had been
<lb n="09188"/>| obliged to offer an abject apology to Mr Alleyne for his
<lb n="09189"/>| impertinence but he knew what a hornet's nest the office would
<lb n="09190"/>| be for him. He could remember the way in which Mr Alleyne
<lb n="09191"/>| had hounded little Peake out of the office in order to make
<lb n="09192"/>| room for his own nephew. He felt savage and thirsty and
<lb n="09193"/>| revengeful, annoyed with himself and with everyone else. Mr
<lb n="09194"/>| Alleyne would never give him an hour's rest: his life would be a
<lb n="09195"/>| hell to him. He had made a proper fool of himself this time.
<lb n="09196"/>| Could he not keep his tongue in his cheek? But they had never
<lb n="09197"/>| pulled together from the first, he and Mr Alleyne, ever since the
<lb n="09198"/>| day Mr Alleyne had overheard him mimicking his north of
<lb n="09199"/>| Ireland accent to amuse Higgins and Miss Parker: that had
<lb n="09200"/>| been the beginning of it. He might have tried Higgins for the
<lb n="09201"/>| money but sure Higgins never had anything for himself. A man
<lb n="09202"/>| with two establishments to keep up, of course he couldn't.</p>
<lb n="09203"/>| <p>He felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the
<lb n="09204"/>| publichouse. The fog had begun to chill him and he wondered
<lb n="09205"/>| could he touch Pat in O'Neill's. He could not touch him for
<lb n="09206"/>| more than a bob - and a bob was no use. Yet he must get
<lb n="09207"/>| money somewhere or other: he had spent his last penny for the
<lb n="09208"/>| g.p. and soon it would be too late for getting money anywhere.
<lb n="09209"/>| Suddenly, as he was fingering his watchchain, he thought of
<lb n="09210"/>| Terry Kelly's pawnoffice in Fleet Street. That was the dart!
<lb n="09211"/>| Why didn't he think of it sooner?</p>
<lb n="09212"/>| <p>He went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly,
<lb n="09213"/>| muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he
<lb n="09214"/>| was going to have a good night of it. The clerk in Terry Kelly's
<lb n="09215"/>| said <emph>A crown!</emph> but the consignor held out for six shillings and in
<lb n="09216"/>| the end the six shillings was allowed him literally. He came out
<lb n="09217"/>| of the pawnoffice joyfully, making a little cylinder of the coins
<lb n="09218"/>| between his thumb and fingers. In Westmoreland Street the
<lb n="09219"/>| footpaths were crowded with young men and women returning
<lb n="09220"/>| from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out
<lb n="09221"/>| the names of the evening editions. The man passed through the
<lb n="09222"/>| crowd, looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfac=
<lb n="09223"/>| tion and staring masterfully at the office girls. His head was full
<lb n="09224"/>| of the noises of tram gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose
<lb n="09225"/>| already sniffed the curling fumes of punch. As he walked on he
<lb n="09226"/>| preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident
<lb n="09227"/>| to the boys:
<lb n="09228"/>| <said who="">--</said>So, I just looked at him - coolly, you know - and looked at
<lb n="09229"/>| her. Then I looked back at him again - taking my time, you
<lb n="09230"/>| know. <emph>I don't think that that's a fair question to put to me</emph>,
<lb n="09231"/>| says I.</p>
<lb n="09232"/>| <p>Nosey Flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of Davy
<lb n="09233"/>| Byrne's and when he heard the story he stood Farrington a half
<lb n="09234"/>| one, saying it was as smart a thing as ever he heard. Farrington
<lb n="09235"/>| stood a drink in his turn. After a while O'Halloran and Paddy
<lb n="09236"/>| Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O'Hal=
<lb n="09237"/>| loran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of
<lb n="09238"/>| the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in
<lb n="09239"/>| Callan's of Fownes's Street; but, as the retort was after the
<lb n="09240"/>| manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to
<lb n="09241"/>| admit that it was not so clever as Farrington's retort. At this
<lb n="09242"/>| Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another.</p>
<lb n="09243"/>| <p>Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in
<lb n="09244"/>| but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The
<lb n="09245"/>| men asked him to give his version of it and he did so with great
<lb n="09246"/>| vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very
<lb n="09247"/>| exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the
<lb n="09248"/>| way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington's face.
<lb n="09249"/>| Then he imitated Farrington, saying <emph>And here was my nabs, as
<lb n="09250"/>| cool as you please</emph>, while Farrington looked at the company
<lb n="09251"/>| out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth
<lb n="09252"/>| stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his
<lb n="09253"/>| lower lip.</p>
<lb n="09254"/>| <p>When that round was over there was a pause. O'Halloran
<lb n="09255"/>| had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any so
<lb n="09256"/>| the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the
<lb n="09257"/>| corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to
<lb n="09258"/>| the left while the other three turned back towards the city. Rain
<lb n="09259"/>| was drizzling down on the cold streets and when they reached
<lb n="09260"/>| the Ballast Office Farrington suggested the Scotch House. The
<lb n="09261"/>| bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and
<lb n="09262"/>| glasses. The three men pushed past the whining matchsellers at
<lb n="09263"/>| the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter.
<lb n="09264"/>| They began to exchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a
<lb n="09265"/>| young fellow named Weathers who was performing at the
<lb n="09266"/>| Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout <emph>artiste.</emph> Farrington stood
<lb n="09267"/>| a drink all round. Weathers said he would take a small Irish
<lb n="09268"/>| and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions of what
<lb n="09269"/>| was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too:
<lb n="09270"/>| but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became
<lb n="09271"/>| theatrical. O'Halloran stood a round and then Farrington
<lb n="09272"/>| stood another round, Weathers protesting that the hospitality
<lb n="09273"/>| was too Irish. He promised to get them in behind the scenes
<lb n="09274"/>| and introduce them to some nice girls. O'Halloran said that he
<lb n="09275"/>| and Leonard would go but that Farrington wouldn't go be=
<lb n="09276"/>| cause he was a married man and Farrington's heavy dirty eyes
<lb n="09277"/>| leered at the company in token that he understood when he
<lb n="09278"/>| was being chaffed. Weathers made them all have just one little
<lb n="09279"/>| tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at
<lb n="09280"/>| Mulligan's in Poolbeg Street.</p>
<lb n="09281"/>| <p>When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulli=
<lb n="09282"/>| gan's. They went into the parlour at the back and O'Halloran
<lb n="09283"/>| ordered small hot specials all round. They were all beginning to
<lb n="09284"/>| feel mellow. Farrington was just standing another round when
<lb n="09285"/>| Weathers came back. Much to Farrington's relief he drank a
<lb n="09286"/>| glass of bitter this time. Funds were running low but they had
<lb n="09287"/>| enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with
<lb n="09288"/>| big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a
<lb n="09289"/>| table close by. Weathers saluted them and told the company
<lb n="09290"/>| that they were out of the Tivoli. Farrington's eyes wandered at
<lb n="09291"/>| every moment in the direction of one of the young women.
<lb n="09292"/>| There was something striking in her appearance. An immense
<lb n="09293"/>| scarf of peacockblue muslin was wound round her hat and
<lb n="09294"/>| knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright
<lb n="09295"/>| yellow gloves reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admir=
<lb n="09296"/>| ingly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with
<lb n="09297"/>| much grace; and, when after a little time she answered his gaze,
<lb n="09298"/>| he admired still more her large dark brown eyes. The oblique
<lb n="09299"/>| staring expression in them fascinated him. She glanced at him
<lb n="09300"/>| once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she
<lb n="09301"/>| brushed against his chair and said <emph>O, pardon!</emph> in a London
<lb n="09302"/>| accent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she
<lb n="09303"/>| would look back at him but he was disappointed. He cursed his
<lb n="09304"/>| want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood,
<lb n="09305"/>| particularly all the whiskies and Apollinaris which he had
<lb n="09306"/>| stood to Weathers. If there was one thing that he hated it was a
<lb n="09307"/>| sponge. He was so angry that he lost count of the conversation
<lb n="09308"/>| of his friends.</p>
<lb n="09309"/>| <p>When Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were
<lb n="09310"/>| talking about feats of strength. Weathers was showing his
<lb n="09311"/>| biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the
<lb n="09312"/>| other two had called on Farrington to uphold the national hon=
<lb n="09313"/>| our. Farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his
<lb n="09314"/>| biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined
<lb n="09315"/>| and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of
<lb n="09316"/>| strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their
<lb n="09317"/>| elbows on it, clasping hands. When Paddy Leonard said <emph>Go!</emph>
<lb n="09318"/>| each was to try to bring down the other's hand on to the table.
<lb n="09319"/>| Farrington looked very serious and determined.</p>
<lb n="09320"/>| <p>The trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers
<lb n="09321"/>| brought his opponent's hand slowly down on to the table. Far=
<lb n="09322"/>| rington's dark winecoloured face flushed darker still with anger
<lb n="09323"/>| and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling.
<lb n="09324"/>| <said who="">--</said>You're not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play
<lb n="09325"/>| fair, he said.
<lb n="09326"/>| <said who="">--</said>Who's not playing fair? said the other.
<lb n="09327"/>| <said who="">--</said>Come on again. The two best out of three.</p>
<lb n="09328"/>| <p>The trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington's
<lb n="09329"/>| forehead and the pallor of Weathers' complexion changed to
<lb n="09330"/>| peony. Their hands and arms trembled under the stress. After a
<lb n="09331"/>| long struggle Weathers again brought his opponent's hand
<lb n="09332"/>| slowly on to the table. There was a murmur of applause from
<lb n="09333"/>| the spectators. The curate, who was standing beside the table,
<lb n="09334"/>| nodded his red head towards the victor and said with loutish
<lb n="09335"/>| familiarity:
<lb n="09336"/>| <said who="">--</said>Ah! that's the knack!
<lb n="09337"/>| <said who="">--</said>What the hell do you know about it? said Farrington
<lb n="09338"/>| fiercely, turning on the man. What do you put in your gab for?
<lb n="09339"/>| <said who="">--</said>'Sh,'sh! said O'Halloran, observing the violent expression of
<lb n="09340"/>| Farrington's face. Pony up, boys. We'll have just one little
<lb n="09341"/>| smahan more and then we'll be off!</p>
<lb n="09342"/>| <p>A very sullenfaced man stood at the corner of O'Connell
<lb n="09343"/>| Bridge waiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him
<lb n="09344"/>| home. He was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness.
<lb n="09345"/>| He felt humiliated and discontented: he did not even feel drunk
<lb n="09346"/>| and he had only twopence in his pocket. He cursed everything.
<lb n="09347"/>| He had done for himself in the office, pawned his watch, spent
<lb n="09348"/>| all his money; and he had not even got drunk. He began to feel
<lb n="09349"/>| thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot reeking
<lb n="09350"/>| publichouse. He had lost his reputation as a strong man,
<lb n="09351"/>| having been defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled
<lb n="09352"/>| with fury and when he thought of the woman in the big hat
<lb n="09353"/>| who had brushed against him and said <emph>Pardon!</emph> his fury nearly
<lb n="09354"/>| choked him.</p>
<lb n="09355"/>| <p>His tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered
<lb n="09356"/>| his great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks.
<lb n="09357"/>| He loathed returning to his home. When he went in by the
<lb n="09358"/>| sidedoor he found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly
<lb n="09359"/>| out. He bawled upstairs:
<lb n="09360"/>| <said who="">--</said>Ada! Ada!</p>
<lb n="09361"/>| <p>His wife was a little sharpfaced woman who bullied her
<lb n="09362"/>| husband when he was sober and was bullied by him when he
<lb n="09363"/>| was drunk. They had five children. A little boy came running
<lb n="09364"/>| down the stairs.
<lb n="09365"/>| <said who="">--</said>Who is that? said the man peering through the darkness.
<lb n="09366"/>| <said who="">--</said>Me, pa.
<lb n="09367"/>| <said who="">--</said>Who are you? Charlie?
<lb n="09368"/>| <said who="">--</said>No, pa. Tom.
<lb n="09369"/>| <said who="">--</said>Where's your mother?
<lb n="09370"/>| <said who="">--</said>She's out at the chapel.
<lb n="09371"/>| <said who="">--</said>That's right .... Did she think of leaving any dinner for me?
<lb n="09372"/>| <said who="">--</said>Yes, pa. I ...
<lb n="09373"/>| <said who="">--</said>Light the lamp. What do you mean by having the place in
<lb n="09374"/>| darkness? Are the other children in bed?</p>
<lb n="09375"/>| <p>The man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the
<lb n="09376"/>| little boy lit the lamp. He began to mimick his son's flat accent,
<lb n="09377"/>| saying half to himself: <emph>At the chapel. At the chapel, if you
<lb n="09378"/>| please!</emph> When the lamp was lit he banged his fist on the table
<lb n="09379"/>| and shouted:
<lb n="09380"/>| <said who="">--</said>What's for my dinner?
<lb n="09381"/>| <said who="">--</said>I'm ... going to cook it, pa, said the little boy.</p>
<lb n="09382"/>| <p>The man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire:
<lb n="09383"/>| <said who="">--</said>On that fire! You let the fire out! By God, I'll teach you to do
<lb n="09384"/>| that again!</p>
<lb n="09385"/>| <p>He took a step to the door and seized the walking stick
<lb n="09386"/>| which was standing behind it:
<lb n="09387"/>| <said who="">--</said>I'll teach you to let the fire out! he said, rolling up his sleeve
<lb n="09388"/>| in order to give his arm free play.</p>
<lb n="09389"/>| <p>The little boy cried <emph>O, pa!</emph> and ran whimpering round the
<lb n="09390"/>| table but the man followed him and caught him by the coat.
<lb n="09391"/>| The little boy looked about him wildly but, seeing no way of
<lb n="09392"/>| escape, fell upon his knees.
<lb n="09393"/>| <said who="">--</said>Now, you'll let the fire out the next time! said the man,
<lb n="09394"/>| striking at him viciously with the stick. Take that, you little
<lb n="09395"/>| whelp!</p>
<lb n="09396"/>| <p>The boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh.
<lb n="09397"/>| He clasped his hands together in the air and his voice shook
<lb n="09398"/>| with fright.
<lb n="09399"/>| <said who="">--</said>O, pa! he cried. Don't beat me, pa! And I'll ... I'll say a <emph>Hail
<lb n="09400"/>| Mary</emph> for you. ... I'll say a <emph>Hail Mary</emph> for you, pa, if you don't
<lb n="09401"/>| beat me. ... I'll say a <emph>Hail Mary.</emph> ...</p>
