      <p class="textParagraph">There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke.
         <br> Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time)
         <br> and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night
         <br> I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01005</span><br> was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the
         <br> darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the
         <br> head of a corpse. He had often said to me: <span class="emph">I am not long for
            <br> this world</span>, and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they
         <br> were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01010</span><br> to myself the word <span class="emph">paralysis</span>. It had always sounded strangely
         <br> in my ears like the word <span class="emph">gnomon</span> in the Euclid and the word
         <br> <span class="emph">simony</span> in the catechism. But now it sounded to me like the
         <br> name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear
         <br> and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01015</span><br> work.
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came
         <br> downstairs to supper. While my aunt was ladling out my
         <br> stirabout he said as if returning to some former remark of his:
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―No, I wouldn't say he was exactly ...... but there was some=
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01020</span><br> thing queer ..... there was something uncanny about him. I'll
            <br> tell you my opinion. ...</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion
         <br> in his mind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he
         <br> used to be rather interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01025</span><br> soon grew tired of him and his endless stories about the
         <br> distillery.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―I have my own theory about it, he said. I think it was one of
            <br> those ... peculiar cases. ... But it's hard to say. ...</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01030</span><br> theory. My uncle saw me staring and said to me:
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―Well, so your old friend is gone, you'll be sorry to hear.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator</span>―Who? said I.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―Father Flynn.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrartor</span>―Is he dead?</span>
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01035</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―Mr Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the
            <br> house.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as
         <br> if the news had not interested me. My uncle explained to old
         <br> Cotter:
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01040</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap
            <br> taught him a great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great
            <br> wish for him.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―God have mercy on his soul, said my aunt piously.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">Old Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01045</span><br> beady black eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy
         <br> him by looking up from my plate. He returned to his pipe and
         <br> finally spat rudely into the grate.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―I wouldn't like children of mine,</span> he said, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>to have too much
            <br> to say to a man like that.</span>
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01050</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―How do you mean, Mr Cotter?</span> asked my aunt.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―What I mean is,</span> said old Cotter, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>it's bad for children. My
            <br> idea is: let a young lad run about and play with young lads of
            <br> his own age and not be. ... Am I right, Jack?</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―That's my principle too,</span> said my uncle. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>Let him learn to box
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01055</span><br> his corner. That's what I'm always saying to that rosicrucian
            <br> there: take exercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning
            <br> of my life I had a cold bath, winter and summer. And that's
            <br> what stands to me now. Education is all very fine and large. ....
            <br> Mr Cotter might take a pick of that leg of mutton,</span> he added to
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01060</span><br> my aunt.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―No, no, not for me, said old Cotter.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">My aunt brought the dish from the safe and laid it on the
         <br> table.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―But why do you think it's not good for children, Mr Cotter?</span>
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01065</span><br> she asked.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―It's bad for children,</span> said old Cotter, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>because their minds are
            <br> so impressionable. When children see things like that, you
            <br> know, it has an effect. .....</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01070</span><br> utterance to my anger. Tiresome old rednosed imbecile!
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">It was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old
         <br> Cotter for alluding to me as a child I puzzled my head to
         <br> extract meaning from his unfinished sentences. In the dark of
         <br> my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01075</span><br> paralytic. I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think
         <br> of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It murmured
         <br> and I understood that it desired to confess something. I felt my
         <br> soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region and there
         <br> again I found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01080</span><br> murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and
         <br> why the lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered
         <br> that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling
         <br> feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin.
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01085</span><br> little house in Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop,
         <br> registered under the vague name of Drapery. The drapery
         <br> consisted mainly of children's bootees and umbrellas and on
         <br> ordinary days a notice used to hang in the window, saying
         <br> <span class="emph">Umbrellas Recovered</span>. No notice was visible now for the
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01090</span><br> shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the doorknocker
         <br> with ribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were
         <br> reading the card pinned on the crape. I also approached and
         <br> read:
      </p>
      
      <p class="lg">
          July 1st 1895
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01095</span> The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine's
          Church, Meath Street) aged sixty-five years.
          R.I.P.
         
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and
         <br> I was disturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01100</span><br> would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to
         <br> find him sitting in his armchair by the fire, nearly smothered in
         <br> his greatcoat. Perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet
         <br> of high toast for him and this present would have roused him
         <br> from his stupefied doze. It was always I who emptied the
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01105</span><br> packet into his black snuffbox for his hands trembled too much
         <br> to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the
         <br> floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose
         <br> little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the
         <br> front of his coat. It may have been these constant showers of
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01110</span><br> snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded
         <br> look for the red handkerchief, blackened as it always was with
         <br> the snuffstains of a week, with which he tried to brush away
         <br> the fallen grains was quite inefficacious.
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01115</span><br> to knock. I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the
         <br> street, reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shopwin=
         <br> dows as I went. I found it strange that neither I nor the day
         <br> seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at
         <br> discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01120</span><br> freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as
         <br> my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great
         <br> deal. He had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had
         <br> taught me to pronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories
         <br> about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte and he
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01125</span><br> had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of
         <br> the mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest.
         <br> Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions
         <br> to me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances
         <br> or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01130</span><br> imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and
         <br> mysterious were certain institutions of the church which I had
         <br> always regarded as the simplest acts. The duties of the priest
         <br> towards the eucharist and towards the secrecy of the con=
         <br> fessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01135</span><br> had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them: and I
         <br> was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the
         <br> church had written books as thick as the post office directory
         <br> and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper
         <br> elucidating all these intricate questions. Often when I thought
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01140</span><br> of this I could make no answer or only a very foolish and
         <br> halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head
         <br> twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me through the re=
         <br> sponses of the mass which he had made me learn by heart: and
         <br> as I pattered he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01145</span><br> and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alter=
         <br> nately. When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured
         <br> teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip - a habit which
         <br> had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance
         <br> before I knew him well.
      </p>
      <span class="tag lineNumber">01150</span> 
      <p class="textParagraph">As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter's
         <br> words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in
         <br> the dream. I remembered that I had noticed long velvet curtains
         <br> and a swinging lamp of antique fashion. I felt that I had been
         <br> very far away, in some land where the customs were strange, in
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01155</span><br> Persia, I thought. ...... But I could not remember the end of the
         <br> dream.
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of
         <br> mourning. It was after sunset but the window panes of the
         <br> houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01160</span><br> great bank of clouds. Nannie received us in the hall and, as it
         <br> would have been unseemly to have shouted at her, my aunt
         <br> shook hands with her for all. The old woman pointed upwards
         <br> interrogatively and, on my aunt's nodding, proceeded to toil up
         <br> the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01165</span><br> above the level of the banister rail. At the first landing she
         <br> stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the
         <br> open door of the deadroom. My aunt went in and the old
         <br> woman, seeing that I hesitated to enter, began to beckon to me
         <br> again repeatedly with her hand.
      </p>
      <span class="tag lineNumber">01170</span> 
      <p class="textParagraph">I went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the
         <br> blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the
         <br> candles looked like pale thin flames. He had been coffined.
         <br> Nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of
         <br> the bed. I pretended to pray but I could not gather my thoughts
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01175</span><br> because the old woman's mutterings distracted me. I noticed
         <br> how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the
         <br> heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side. The
         <br> fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there
         <br> in his coffin.
      </p>
      <span class="tag lineNumber">01180</span> 
      <p class="textParagraph">But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I
         <br> saw that he was not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious,
         <br> vested as for the altar, his large hands loosely retaining a
         <br> chalice. His face was very truculent, grey and massive, with
         <br> black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur.
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01185</span><br> There was a heavy odour in the room, the flowers.
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">We blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room
         <br> downstairs we found Eliza seated in his armchair in state. I
         <br> groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while
         <br> Nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01190</span><br> sherry and some wineglasses. She set these on the table and
         <br> invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at her sister's
         <br> bidding, she poured out the sherry into the glasses and passed
         <br> them to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also
         <br> but I declined because I thought I would make too much noise
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01195</span><br> eating them. She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my
         <br> refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down
         <br> behind her sister. No-one spoke: we all gazed at the empty
         <br> fireplace.
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01200</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Ah, well, he's gone to a better world.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt
         <br> fingered the stem of her wineglass before sipping a little.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Did he ..... peacefully?</span> she asked.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―O, quite peacefully, ma'am,</span> said Eliza. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>You couldn't tell
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01205</span><br> when the breath went out of him. He had a beautiful death,
            <br> God be praised.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―And everything .... ?</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Father O'Rourke was in with him a-Tuesday and anointed
            <br> him and prepared him and all.</span>
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01210</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―He knew then?</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―He was quite resigned.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―He looks quite resigned, said my aunt.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―That's what the woman we had in to wash him said. She
            <br> said he just looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01215</span><br> and resigned. No-one would think he'd make such a beautiful
            <br> corpse.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Yes, indeed, said my aunt.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">She sipped a little more from her glass and said:
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01220</span><br> you to know that you did all you could for him. You were both
            <br> very kind to him, I must say.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Ah, poor James! she said. God knows we done all we could
            <br> as poor as we are. We wouldn't see him want anything while he
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01225</span><br> was in it.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa pillow and
         <br> seemed about to fall asleep.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―There's poor Nannie, said Eliza looking at her, she's wore
            <br> out. All the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01230</span><br> wash him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then
            <br> arranging about the mass in the chapel! Only for Father
            <br> O'Rourke I don't know what we'd have done at all. It was him
            <br> brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks out of
            <br> the chapel and wrote out the notice for the Freeman's General
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01235</span><br> and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor
            <br> James's insurance.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrartor's aunt</span>―Wasn't that good of him? said my aunt.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Ah, there's no friends like the old friends, she said, when all
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01240</span><br> is said and done, no friends that a body can trust.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Indeed, that's true, said my aunt. And I'm sure now that he's
            <br> gone to his eternal reward he won't forget you and all your
            <br> kindness to him.</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Ah, poor James!</span> said Eliza. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>He was no great trouble to us.
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01245</span><br> You wouldn't hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I
            <br> know he's gone and all that ....</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―It's when it's all over that you'll miss him,</span> said my aunt.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―I know that,</span> said Eliza. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>I won't be bringing him in his cup of
            <br> beeftea any more nor you, ma'am, sending him his snuff. Ah,
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01250</span><br> poor James!</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">She stopped, as if she were communing with the past, and
         <br> then said shrewdly:
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over
            <br> him latterly. Whenever I'd bring in his soup to him there I'd
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01255</span><br> find him with his breviary fallen on the floor, lying back in the
            <br> chair and his mouth open.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">She laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she
         <br> continued:
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01260</span><br> was over he'd go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old
            <br> house again where we were all born down in Irishtown and
            <br> take me and Nannie with him. If we could only get one of them
            <br> newfangled carriages that makes no noise that Father
            <br> O'Rourke told him about - them with the rheumatic wheels -
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01265</span><br> for the day cheap, he said, at Johnny Rush's over the way there
            <br> and drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening. He
            <br> had his mind set on that. ... Poor James!</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―The Lord have mercy on his soul!</span> said my aunt.
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it.
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01270</span><br> Then she put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the
         <br> empty grate for some time without speaking.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―He was too scrupulous always,</span> she said. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>The duties of the
            <br> priesthood was too much for him. And then his life was, you
            <br> might say, crossed.</span>
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01275</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Yes,</span> said my aunt, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>he was a disappointed man. You could
            <br> see that.</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">A silence took possession of the little room and under cover
         <br> of it I approached the table and tasted my sherry and then
         <br> returned quietly to my chair in the corner. Eliza seemed to have
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01280</span><br> fallen into a deep revery. We waited respectfully for her to
         <br> break the silence: and after a long pause she said slowly:
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―It was that chalice he broke. ... That was what was the
            <br> beginning of it. Of course, they say it was all right, that it
            <br> contained nothing, I mean. But still ....... They say it was the
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01285</span><br> boy's fault. But poor James was so nervous, God be merciful to
            <br> him!</span>
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―And was that it? said my aunt. I heard something. .......</span></p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">Eliza nodded.
         <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―That affected his mind,</span> she said. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>After that he began to
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01290</span><br> mope by himself, talking to no-one and wandering about by
            <br> himself. So one night he was wanted for to go on a call and
            <br> they couldn't find him anywhere. They looked high up and low
            <br> down and still they couldn't see a sight of him anywhere. So
            <br> then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So then they got the
            <span class="tag lineNumber">01295</span><br> keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father O'Rourke
            <br> and another priest that was there brought in a light for to look
            <br> for him. .... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up
            <br> by himself in the dark in his confession box, wideawake and
            <br> laughing-like softly to himself?</span></p>
      <span class="tag lineNumber">01300</span> 
      <p class="textParagraph">She stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened but there
         <br> was no sound in the house and I knew that the old priest was
         <br> lying still in his coffin as we had seen him, solemn and
         <br> truculent in death, an idle chalice on his breast.
      </p>
       
      <p class="textParagraph">Eliza resumed:
         <span class="tag lineNumber">01305</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Wideawake and laughing-like to himself. ... So then of
            <br> course when they saw that that made them think that there was
            <br> something gone wrong with him. ....</span></p>
