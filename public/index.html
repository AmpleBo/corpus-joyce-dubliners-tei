<br> <p class="textParagraph">There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke.
<br> Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time)
<br> and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night
<br> I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he
<span class="tag lineNumber">01005</span><br> was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the
<br> darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the
<br> head of a corpse. He had often said to me: <span class="emph">I am not long for
<br> this world</span>, and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they
<br> were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly
<span class="tag lineNumber">01010</span><br> to myself the word <span class="emph">paralysis</span>. It had always sounded strangely
<br> in my ears like the word <span class="emph">gnomon</span> in the Euclid and the word
<br> <span class="emph">simony</span> in the catechism. But now it sounded to me like the
<br> name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear
<br> and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly
<span class="tag lineNumber">01015</span><br> work.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came
<br> downstairs to supper. While my aunt was ladling out my
<br> stirabout he said as if returning to some former remark of his:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―No, I wouldn't say he was exactly ...... but there was some=
<span class="tag lineNumber">01020</span><br> thing queer ..... there was something uncanny about him. I'll
<br> tell you my opinion. ...</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion
<br> in his mind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he
<br> used to be rather interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I
<span class="tag lineNumber">01025</span><br> soon grew tired of him and his endless stories about the
<br> distillery.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―I have my own theory about it, he said. I think it was one of
<br> those ... peculiar cases. ... But it's hard to say. ...</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his
<span class="tag lineNumber">01030</span><br> theory. My uncle saw me staring and said to me:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―Well, so your old friend is gone, you'll be sorry to hear.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator</span>―Who? said I.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―Father Flynn.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrartor</span>―Is he dead?</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">01035</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―Mr Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the
<br> house.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as
<br> if the news had not interested me. My uncle explained to old
<br> Cotter:
<span class="tag lineNumber">01040</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap
<br> taught him a great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great
<br> wish for him.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―God have mercy on his soul, said my aunt piously.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Old Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little
<span class="tag lineNumber">01045</span><br> beady black eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy
<br> him by looking up from my plate. He returned to his pipe and
<br> finally spat rudely into the grate.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―I wouldn't like children of mine,</span> he said, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>to have too much
<br> to say to a man like that.</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">01050</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―How do you mean, Mr Cotter?</span> asked my aunt.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―What I mean is,</span> said old Cotter, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>it's bad for children. My
<br> idea is: let a young lad run about and play with young lads of
<br> his own age and not be. ... Am I right, Jack?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>―That's my principle too,</span> said my uncle. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's uncle</span>Let him learn to box
<span class="tag lineNumber">01055</span><br> his corner. That's what I'm always saying to that rosicrucian
<br> there: take exercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning
<br> of my life I had a cold bath, winter and summer. And that's
<br> what stands to me now. Education is all very fine and large. ....
<br> Mr Cotter might take a pick of that leg of mutton,</span> he added to
<span class="tag lineNumber">01060</span><br> my aunt.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―No, no, not for me, said old Cotter.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">My aunt brought the dish from the safe and laid it on the
<br> table.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―But why do you think it's not good for children, Mr Cotter?</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">01065</span><br> she asked.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>―It's bad for children,</span> said old Cotter, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Cotter</span>because their minds are
<br> so impressionable. When children see things like that, you
<br> know, it has an effect. .....</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give
<span class="tag lineNumber">01070</span><br> utterance to my anger. Tiresome old rednosed imbecile!</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">It was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old
<br> Cotter for alluding to me as a child I puzzled my head to
<br> extract meaning from his unfinished sentences. In the dark of
<br> my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the
<span class="tag lineNumber">01075</span><br> paralytic. I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think
<br> of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It murmured
<br> and I understood that it desired to confess something. I felt my
<br> soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region and there
<br> again I found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a
<span class="tag lineNumber">01080</span><br> murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and
<br> why the lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered
<br> that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling
<br> feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the
<span class="tag lineNumber">01085</span><br> little house in Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop,
<br> registered under the vague name of Drapery. The drapery
<br> consisted mainly of children's bootees and umbrellas and on
<br> ordinary days a notice used to hang in the window, saying
<br> <span class="emph">Umbrellas Recovered</span>. No notice was visible now for the
<span class="tag lineNumber">01090</span><br> shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the doorknocker
<br> with ribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were
<br> reading the card pinned on the crape. I also approached and
<br> read:</p>
<p class="lg">
<br> July 1st 1895
<span class="tag lineNumber">01095</span><br> The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine's
<br> Church, Meath Street) aged sixty-five years.
<br> R.I.P.
</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and
<br> I was disturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I
<span class="tag lineNumber">01100</span><br> would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to
<br> find him sitting in his armchair by the fire, nearly smothered in
<br> his greatcoat. Perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet
<br> of high toast for him and this present would have roused him
<br> from his stupefied doze. It was always I who emptied the
<span class="tag lineNumber">01105</span><br> packet into his black snuffbox for his hands trembled too much
<br> to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the
<br> floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose
<br> little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the
<br> front of his coat. It may have been these constant showers of
<span class="tag lineNumber">01110</span><br> snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded
<br> look for the red handkerchief, blackened as it always was with
<br> the snuffstains of a week, with which he tried to brush away
<br> the fallen grains was quite inefficacious.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage
<span class="tag lineNumber">01115</span><br> to knock. I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the
<br> street, reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shopwin=
<br> dows as I went. I found it strange that neither I nor the day
<br> seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at
<br> discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been
<span class="tag lineNumber">01120</span><br> freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as
<br> my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great
<br> deal. He had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had
<br> taught me to pronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories
<br> about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte and he
<span class="tag lineNumber">01125</span><br> had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of
<br> the mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest.
<br> Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions
<br> to me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances
<br> or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only
<span class="tag lineNumber">01130</span><br> imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and
<br> mysterious were certain institutions of the church which I had
<br> always regarded as the simplest acts. The duties of the priest
<br> towards the eucharist and towards the secrecy of the con=
<br> fessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody
<span class="tag lineNumber">01135</span><br> had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them: and I
<br> was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the
<br> church had written books as thick as the post office directory
<br> and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper
<br> elucidating all these intricate questions. Often when I thought
<span class="tag lineNumber">01140</span><br> of this I could make no answer or only a very foolish and
<br> halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head
<br> twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me through the re=
<br> sponses of the mass which he had made me learn by heart: and
<br> as I pattered he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now
<span class="tag lineNumber">01145</span><br> and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alter=
<br> nately. When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured
<br> teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip - a habit which
<br> had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance
<br> before I knew him well.</p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">01150</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter's
<br> words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in
<br> the dream. I remembered that I had noticed long velvet curtains
<br> and a swinging lamp of antique fashion. I felt that I had been
<br> very far away, in some land where the customs were strange, in
<span class="tag lineNumber">01155</span><br> Persia, I thought. ...... But I could not remember the end of the
<br> dream.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of
<br> mourning. It was after sunset but the window panes of the
<br> houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a
<span class="tag lineNumber">01160</span><br> great bank of clouds. Nannie received us in the hall and, as it
<br> would have been unseemly to have shouted at her, my aunt
<br> shook hands with her for all. The old woman pointed upwards
<br> interrogatively and, on my aunt's nodding, proceeded to toil up
<br> the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely
<span class="tag lineNumber">01165</span><br> above the level of the banister rail. At the first landing she
<br> stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the
<br> open door of the deadroom. My aunt went in and the old
<br> woman, seeing that I hesitated to enter, began to beckon to me
<br> again repeatedly with her hand.</p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">01170</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">I went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the
<br> blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the
<br> candles looked like pale thin flames. He had been coffined.
<br> Nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of
<br> the bed. I pretended to pray but I could not gather my thoughts
<span class="tag lineNumber">01175</span><br> because the old woman's mutterings distracted me. I noticed
<br> how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the
<br> heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side. The
<br> fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there
<br> in his coffin.</p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">01180</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I
<br> saw that he was not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious,
<br> vested as for the altar, his large hands loosely retaining a
<br> chalice. His face was very truculent, grey and massive, with
<br> black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur.
<span class="tag lineNumber">01185</span><br> There was a heavy odour in the room, the flowers.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">We blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room
<br> downstairs we found Eliza seated in his armchair in state. I
<br> groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while
<br> Nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of
<span class="tag lineNumber">01190</span><br> sherry and some wineglasses. She set these on the table and
<br> invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at her sister's
<br> bidding, she poured out the sherry into the glasses and passed
<br> them to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also
<br> but I declined because I thought I would make too much noise
<span class="tag lineNumber">01195</span><br> eating them. She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my
<br> refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down
<br> behind her sister. No-one spoke: we all gazed at the empty
<br> fireplace.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:
<span class="tag lineNumber">01200</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Ah, well, he's gone to a better world.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt
<br> fingered the stem of her wineglass before sipping a little.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Did he ..... peacefully?</span> she asked.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―O, quite peacefully, ma'am,</span> said Eliza. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>You couldn't tell
<span class="tag lineNumber">01205</span><br> when the breath went out of him. He had a beautiful death,
<br> God be praised.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―And everything .... ?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Father O'Rourke was in with him a-Tuesday and anointed
<br> him and prepared him and all.</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">01210</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―He knew then?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―He was quite resigned.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―He looks quite resigned, said my aunt.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―That's what the woman we had in to wash him said. She
<br> said he just looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful
<span class="tag lineNumber">01215</span><br> and resigned. No-one would think he'd make such a beautiful
<br> corpse.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Yes, indeed, said my aunt.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">She sipped a little more from her glass and said:
    <br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for
<span class="tag lineNumber">01220</span><br> you to know that you did all you could for him. You were both
<br> very kind to him, I must say.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Ah, poor James! she said. God knows we done all we could
<br> as poor as we are. We wouldn't see him want anything while he
<span class="tag lineNumber">01225</span><br> was in it.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa pillow and
<br> seemed about to fall asleep.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―There's poor Nannie, said Eliza looking at her, she's wore
<br> out. All the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to
<span class="tag lineNumber">01230</span><br> wash him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then
<br> arranging about the mass in the chapel! Only for Father
<br> O'Rourke I don't know what we'd have done at all. It was him
<br> brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks out of
<br> the chapel and wrote out the notice for the Freeman's General
<span class="tag lineNumber">01235</span><br> and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor
<br> James's insurance.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrartor's aunt</span>―Wasn't that good of him? said my aunt.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Ah, there's no friends like the old friends, she said, when all
<span class="tag lineNumber">01240</span><br> is said and done, no friends that a body can trust.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Indeed, that's true, said my aunt. And I'm sure now that he's
<br> gone to his eternal reward he won't forget you and all your
<br> kindness to him.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Ah, poor James!</span> said Eliza. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>He was no great trouble to us.
<span class="tag lineNumber">01245</span><br> You wouldn't hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I
<br> know he's gone and all that ....</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―It's when it's all over that you'll miss him,</span> said my aunt.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―I know that,</span> said Eliza. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>I won't be bringing him in his cup of
<br> beeftea any more nor you, ma'am, sending him his snuff. Ah,
<span class="tag lineNumber">01250</span><br> poor James!</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">She stopped, as if she were communing with the past, and
<br> then said shrewdly:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over
<br> him latterly. Whenever I'd bring in his soup to him there I'd
<span class="tag lineNumber">01255</span><br> find him with his breviary fallen on the floor, lying back in the
<br> chair and his mouth open.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">She laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she
<br> continued:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer
<span class="tag lineNumber">01260</span><br> was over he'd go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old
<br> house again where we were all born down in Irishtown and
<br> take me and Nannie with him. If we could only get one of them
<br> newfangled carriages that makes no noise that Father
<br> O'Rourke told him about - them with the rheumatic wheels -
<span class="tag lineNumber">01265</span><br> for the day cheap, he said, at Johnny Rush's over the way there
<br> and drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening. He
<br> had his mind set on that. ... Poor James!</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―The Lord have mercy on his soul!</span> said my aunt.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it.
<span class="tag lineNumber">01270</span><br> Then she put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the
<br> empty grate for some time without speaking.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―He was too scrupulous always,</span> she said. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>The duties of the
<br> priesthood was too much for him. And then his life was, you
<br> might say, crossed.</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">01275</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―Yes,</span> said my aunt, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>he was a disappointed man. You could
<br> see that.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">A silence took possession of the little room and under cover
<br> of it I approached the table and tasted my sherry and then
<br> returned quietly to my chair in the corner. Eliza seemed to have
<span class="tag lineNumber">01280</span><br> fallen into a deep revery. We waited respectfully for her to
<br> break the silence: and after a long pause she said slowly:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―It was that chalice he broke. ... That was what was the
<br> beginning of it. Of course, they say it was all right, that it
<br> contained nothing, I mean. But still ....... They say it was the
<span class="tag lineNumber">01285</span><br> boy's fault. But poor James was so nervous, God be merciful to
<br> him!</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―And was that it? said my aunt. I heard something. .......</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Eliza nodded.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>―That affected his mind,</span> she said. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">narrator's aunt</span>After that he began to
<span class="tag lineNumber">01290</span><br> mope by himself, talking to no-one and wandering about by
<br> himself. So one night he was wanted for to go on a call and
<br> they couldn't find him anywhere. They looked high up and low
<br> down and still they couldn't see a sight of him anywhere. So
<br> then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So then they got the
<span class="tag lineNumber">01295</span><br> keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father O'Rourke
<br> and another priest that was there brought in a light for to look
<br> for him. .... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up
<br> by himself in the dark in his confession box, wideawake and
<br> laughing-like softly to himself?</span></p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">01300</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">She stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened but there
<br> was no sound in the house and I knew that the old priest was
<br> lying still in his coffin as we had seen him, solemn and

<br> <p class="textParagraph">Eliza resumed:
<span class="tag lineNumber">01305</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Eliza</span>―Wideawake and laughing-like to himself. ... So then of

    <h2 class="heading"> <span class="tag lineNumber">12000</span><br> <span class="emph">Ivy Day in the Committee Room</span> </h2>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Old Jack raked the cinders together with a piece of card=
<br> board and spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of
<br> coals. When the dome was thinly covered his face lapsed into
<br> darkness but as he set himself to fan the fire again his crouch=
<span class="tag lineNumber">12005</span><br> ing shadow ascended the opposite wall and his face slowly
<br> re-emerged into light. It was an old man's face, very bony and
<br> hairy. The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist
<br> mouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically
<br> when it closed. When the cinders had caught he laid the piece
<span class="tag lineNumber">12010</span><br> of cardboard against the wall, sighed and said:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―That's better now, Mr O'Connor.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr O'Connor, a greyhaired young man, whose face was
<br> disfigured by many blotches and pimples, had just brought the
<br> tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but, when
<span class="tag lineNumber">12015</span><br> spoken to, he undid his handiwork meditatively. Then he be=
<br> gan to roll the tobacco again meditatively and, after a mo=
<br> ment's thought, decided to lick the paper.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Did Mr Tierney say when he'd be back? he asked in a husky
<br> <span class="emph">falsetto.</span></span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12020</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―He didn't say.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr O'Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began to
<br> search his pockets. He took out a pack of thin pasteboard
<br> cards.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―I'll get you a match,</span> said the old man.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12025</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Never mind, this'll do,</span> said Mr O'Connor.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">He selected one of the cards and read what was printed on
<br> it:</p>
<p class="lg">
<br> Municipal Elections
<br> Royal Exchange Ward
<span class="tag lineNumber">12030</span><br> Mr Richard J Tierney P. L. G. respectfully solicits
<br> the favour of your vote and influence at the coming
<br> election in the Royal Exchange Ward.
</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr O'Connor had been engaged by Mr Tierney's agent to
<br> canvass one part of the ward but, as the weather was inclement
<span class="tag lineNumber">12035</span><br> and his boots let in the wet, he spent a great part of the day
<br> sitting by the fire in the Committee Room in Wicklow Street
<br> with Jack, the old caretaker. They had been sitting thus since
<br> the short day had grown dark. It was the sixth of October,
<br> dismal and cold out of doors.</p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12040</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr O'Connor tore off a strip of the card and, lighting it, lit
<br> his cigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy
<br> ivy in the lapel of his coat. The old man watched him attent=
<br> ively and then, taking up the piece of cardboard again, began to
<br> fan the fire slowly while his companion smoked.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12045</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Ah, yes,</span> he said, continuing, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>it's hard to know what way to
<br> bring up children. Now who'd think he'd turn out like that. I
<br> sent him to the Christian Brothers and I done what I could for
<br> him and there he goes boosing about. I tried to make him
<br> someway decent.</span></p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12050</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">He replaced the cardboard wearily.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Only I'm an old man now I'd change his tune for him. I'd
<br> take the stick to his back and beat him while I could stand over

<span class="tag lineNumber">12055</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―That's what ruins children,</span> said Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―To be sure it is, said the old man. And little thanks you get
<br> for it, only impudence. He takes the upper hand of me when=

<br> sons speaks that way to their father?</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12060</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―What age is he?</span> said Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Nineteen,</span> said the old man.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Why don't you put him to something?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Sure, amn't I never done at the drunken bowsey ever since
<br> he left school. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>I won't keep you</span>, I says. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>You must get a job for
<span class="tag lineNumber">12065</span><br> yourself.</span> But, sure, it's worse whenever he gets a job: he drinks
<br> it all.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr O'Connor shook his head in sympathy and the old man
<br> fell silent, gazing into the fire. Someone opened the door of the
<br> room and called out:
<span class="tag lineNumber">12070</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Hello! Is this a Freemasons' meeting?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Who's that?</span> said the old man.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―What are you doing in the dark?</span> asked a voice.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Is that you, Hynes?</span> asked Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―Yes. What are you doing in the dark?</span> said Mr Hynes
<span class="tag lineNumber">12075</span><br> advancing into the light of the fire.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">He was a tall slender young man with a light brown mous=
<br> tache. Imminent little drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat
<br> and the collar of his jacket coat was turned up.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―Well, Mat, he said to Mr O'Connor, how goes it?</span></p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12080</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr O'Connor shook his head. The old man left the hearth
<br> and after stumbling about the room returned with two candle=
<br> sticks which he thrust one after the other into the fire and
<br> carried to the table. A denuded room came into view and the
<br> fire lost all its cheerful colour. The walls of the room were bare
<span class="tag lineNumber">12085</span><br> except for a copy of an election address. In the middle of the
<br> room was a small table on which papers were heaped.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―Has he paid you yet?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Not yet, said Mr O'Connor. I hope to God he'll not leave us
<span class="tag lineNumber">12090</span><br> in the lurch tonight.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Hynes laughed.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―O, he'll pay you. Never fear,</span> he said.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―I hope he'll look smart about it if he means business,</span> said
<br> Mr O'Connor.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12095</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―What do you think, Jack?</span> said Mr Hynes satirically to the
<br> old man.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">The old man returned to his seat by the fire, saying:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―It isn't but he has it, anyway. Not like the other tinker.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―What other tinker?</span> said Mr Hynes.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12100</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Colgan,</span> said the old man scornfully.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―Is it because Colgan's a workingman you say that? What's
<br> the difference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican
<br> —eh? Hasn't the workingman as good a right to be in the
<br> Corporation as anyone else—aye, and a better right than those
<span class="tag lineNumber">12105</span><br> shoneens that are always hat in hand before any fellow with a
<br> handle to his name? Isn't that so, Mat?</span> said Mr Hynes,
<br> addressing Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―I think you're right,</span> said Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―One man is a plain honest man with no hunkersliding about
<span class="tag lineNumber">12110</span><br> him. He goes in to represent the labour classes. This fellow
<br> you're working for only wants to get some job or other.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Of course, the working classes should be represented,</span> said
<br> the old man.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―The workingman, said Mr Hynes, gets all kicks and no
<span class="tag lineNumber">12115</span><br> halfpence. But it's labour produces everything. The working=
<br> man is not looking for fat jobs for his sons and nephews and
<br> cousins.The workingman is not going to drag the honour of
<br> Dublin in the mud to please a German monarch.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―How's that?</span> said the old man.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12120</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―Don't you know they want to present an address of welcome
<br> to Edward Rex if he comes here next year? What do we want
<br> kowtowing to a foreign king?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Our man won't vote for the address,</span> said Mr O'Connor. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>He
<br> goes in on the nationalist ticket.</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12125</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―Won't he?</span> said Mr Hynes. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>Wait till you see whether he will
<br> or not. I know him. Is it Tricky Dicky Tierney?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―By God! perhaps you're right, Joe,</span> said Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>Anyway I wish he'd turn up with the spondulics.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">The three men fell silent. The old man began to rake more
<span class="tag lineNumber">12130</span><br> cinders together. Mr Hynes took off his hat, shook it and then
<br> turned down the collar of his coat, displaying, as he did so, an
<br> ivy leaf in the lapel.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―If this man was alive,</span> he said, pointing to the leaf, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>we'd have
<br> no talk of an address of welcome.</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12135</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―That's true,</span> said Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Musha, God be with them times!</span> said the old man. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>There
<br> was some life in it then.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">The room was silent again. Then a bustling little man with a
<br> snuffling nose and very cold ears pushed in the door. He
<span class="tag lineNumber">12140</span><br> walked over quickly to the fire, rubbing his hands as if he
<br> intended to produce a spark from them.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―No money, boys,</span> he said.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Sit down here, Mr Henchy,</span> said the old man, offering him
<br> his chair.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12145</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―O, don't stir, Jack, don't stir,</span> said Mr Henchy.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">He nodded curtly to Mr Hynes and sat down on the chair
<br> which the old man vacated.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Did you serve Aungier Street?</span> he asked Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Yes, said Mr O'Connor,</span> beginning to search his pockets for
<span class="tag lineNumber">12150</span><br> memoranda.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Did you call on Grimes?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―I did.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Well? How does he stand?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―He wouldn't promise. He said: <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Grimes</span>I won't tell anyone what way
<span class="tag lineNumber">12155</span><br> I'm going to vote.</span> But I think he'll be all right.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Why so?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―He asked me who the nominators were and I told him. I
<br> mentioned Father Burke's name. I think it'll be all right.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hands over the
<span class="tag lineNumber">12160</span><br> fire at a terrific speed. Then he said:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―For the love of God, Jack, bring us in a bit of coal. There
<br> must be some left.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">The old man went out of the room.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―It's no go, said Mr Henchy, shaking his head. I asked
<span class="tag lineNumber">12165</span><br> the little shoeboy but he said: <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">shoeboy</span>O, now, Mr Henchy, when I
<br> see the work going on properly I won't forget you, you may
<br> be sure.</span> Mean little tinker! 'Usha, how could he be anything
<br> else?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―What did I tell you, Mat?</span> said Mr Hynes. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>Tricky Dicky
<span class="tag lineNumber">12170</span><br> Tierney.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―O, he's as tricky as they make 'em,</span> said Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>He
<br> hasn't got those little pig's eyes for nothing. Blast his soul!
<br> Couldn't he pay up like a man instead of: <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dicky Tierney?</span>O, now, Mr Henchy,
<br> I must speak to Mr Fanning ... I've spent a lot of money?</span> Mean
<span class="tag lineNumber">12175</span><br> little shoeboy of hell! I suppose he forgets the time his little old
<br> father kept the hand-me-down shop in Mary's Lane.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―But is that a fact?</span> asked Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―God, yes!</span> said Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>Did you never hear that? And the
<br> men used to go in on Sunday morning before the houses were
<span class="tag lineNumber">12180</span><br> open to buy a waistcoat or a trousers—moya!—but Tricky
<br> Dicky's little old father always had a tricky little black bottle
<br> up in a corner. Do you mind now? That's that. That's where he
<br> first saw the light.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">The old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he
<span class="tag lineNumber">12185</span><br> placed here and there on the fire.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―That's a nice how-do-you-do,</span> said Mr O'Connor. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>How does
<br> he expect us to work for him if he won't stump up?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―I can't help it,</span> said Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>I expect to find the bailiffs in
<br> the hall when I go home.</span></p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12190</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Hynes laughed and, shoving himself away from the
<br> mantelpiece with the aid of his shoulders, made ready to leave.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―It'll be all right when King Eddie comes,</span> he said. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>Well, boys,
<br> I'm off for the present. See you later. 'Bye,'bye.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">He went out of the room slowly. Neither Mr Henchy nor the
<span class="tag lineNumber">12195</span><br> old man said anything but, just as the door was closing, Mr
<br> O'Connor, who had been staring moodily into the fire, called
<br> out suddenly:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―'Bye, Joe.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Tell me, he said across the fire, what brings our friend in
<br> here? What does he want?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―'Usha, poor Joe!</span> said Mr O'Connor throwing the end of his
<br> cigarette into the fire. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>He's hard up like the rest of us.</span></p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12205</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he
<br> nearly put out the fire which uttered a hissing protest.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―To tell you my private and candid opinion,</span> he said, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>I think
<br> he's a man from the other camp. He's a spy of Colgan's, if you
<br> ask me. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Colgan?</span>Just go round and try and find out how they're getting

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―His father was a decent respectable man, Mr Henchy ad=

<br> day! But I'm greatly afraid our friend is not nineteen carat.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12215</span><br> Damn it, I can understand a fellow being hard up but what I
<br> can't understand is a fellow sponging. Couldn't he have some
<br> spark of manhood about him?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―He doesn't get a warm welcome from me when he comes,</span>
<br> said the old man. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>Let him work for his own side and not come

<br> cigarette papers and tobacco. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>I think Joe Hynes is a straight

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―There's no knowing,</span> said the old man.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12230</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―O, but I know it for a fact,</span> said Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>They're Castle

<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr O'Connor nodded.

<span class="tag lineNumber">12240</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">There was a knock at the door.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Come in!</span> said Mr Henchy.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">A person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor
<br> appeared in the doorway. His black clothes were tightly but=
<br> toned on his short body and it was impossible to say whether
<span class="tag lineNumber">12245</span><br> he wore a clergyman's collar or a layman's because the collar
<br> of his shabby frock coat, the uncovered buttons of which
<br> reflected the candlelight, was turned up about his neck. He
<br> wore a round hat of hard black felt. His face, shining with
<br> raindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save
<span class="tag lineNumber">12250</span><br> where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones. He opened his
<br> very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and at the
<br> same time opened wide his very bright blue eyes to express
<br> pleasure and surprise.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―O, Father Keon!</span> said Mr Henchy, jumping up from his

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Keon</span>―O, no, no, no!</span> said Father Keon quickly, pursing up his lips

<span class="tag lineNumber">12280</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Ask me an easier one,</span> said Mr Henchy.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Fanning and himself seem to me very thick. They're often in

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―'Mmmyes, I believe so ... I think he's what you call a black

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―And how does he knock it out?</span> asked Mr O'Connor.

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Well, I couldn't go over while he was talking to Alderman

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―There's some deal on in that quarter,</span> said Mr O'Connor

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>You must owe the City Fathers money nowadays if you want to

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy and Mr O'Connor</span>―What?</span> said Mr Henchy and Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―He told me: <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Keegan</span>What do you think of a Lord Mayor of Dublin

<br> <p class="textParagraph">At this point there was a knock at the door and a boy put in
<br> his head.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12335</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―What is it?</span> said the old man.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">delivery boy</span>―From the Black Eagle</span>, said the boy, walking in sideways and

<br> <p class="textParagraph">The old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the

<span class="tag lineNumber">12340</span><br> the boy put his basket on his arm and asked:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">delivery boy</span>―Any bottles?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―What bottles? said the old man.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Won't you let us drink them first?</span> said Mr Henchy.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">delivery boy</span>―I was told to ask for bottles.</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12345</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―Come back tomorrow,</span> said the old man.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Here, boy!</span> said Mr Henchy, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>will you run over to O'Farrell's
<br> and ask him to lend us a corkscrew—for Mr Henchy, say. Tell
<br> him we won't keep it a minute. Leave the basket there.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">The boy went out and Mr Henchy began to rub his hands
<span class="tag lineNumber">12350</span><br> cheerfully, saying:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Ah, well, he's not so bad after all. He's as good as his word,
<br> anyhow.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―There's no tumblers,</span> said the old man.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―O, don't let that trouble you,</span> Jack, said Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>Many's
<span class="tag lineNumber">12355</span><br> the good man before now drank out of the bottle.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Anyway it's better than nothing,</span> said Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―He's not a bad sort,</span> said Mr Henchy, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>only Fanning has such
<br> a loan of him. He means well, you know, in his own tinpot
<br> way.</span></p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12360</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">The boy came back with the corkscrew. The old man
<br> opened three bottles and was handing back the corkscrew
<br> when Mr Henchy said to the boy:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Would you like a drink, boy?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">delivery boy</span>―If you please, sir, said the boy.</span></p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12365</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">The old man opened another bottle grudgingly and handed
<br> it to the boy.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―What age are you?</span> he asked.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">delivery boy</span>―Seventeen,</span> said the boy.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">As the old man said nothing further the boy took the bottle,
<span class="tag lineNumber">12370</span><br> said: <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">delivery boy</span>Here's my best respects, sir!</span> to Mr Henchy, drank the
<br> contents, put the bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth
<br> with his sleeve. Then he took up the corkscrew and went out of
<br> the door sideways, muttering some form of salutation.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―That's the way it begins,</span> said the old man.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12375</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―The thin end of the wedge,</span> said Mr Henchy.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">The old man distributed the three bottles which he had
<br> opened and the men drank from them simultaneously. After
<br> having drunk each placed his bottle on the mantelpiece within
<br> hand's reach and drew in a long breath of satisfaction.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12380</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Well, I did a good day's work today,</span> said Mr Henchy after a
<br> pause.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack?</span>―That so, John?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Yes. I got him one or two sure things in Dawson Street,
<br> Crofton and myself. Between ourselves, you know, Crofton
<span class="tag lineNumber">12385</span><br> (he's a decent chap, of course), but he's not worth a damn as a
<br> canvasser. He hasn't a word to throw to a dog. He stands and
<br> looks at the people while I do the talking.</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Here two men entered the room. One of them was a very fat
<br> man, whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling
<span class="tag lineNumber">12390</span><br> from his sloping figure. He had a big face which resembled a
<br> young ox's face in expression, staring blue eyes and a grizzled
<br> moustache. The other man, who was much younger and frailer,
<br> had a thin cleanshaven face. He wore a very high double collar
<br> and a widebrimmed bowler hat.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12395</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Hello, Crofton!</span> said Mr Henchy to the fat man. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>Talk of the

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Crofton</span>―Where did the boose come from?</span> asked the young man. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Crofton</span>Did
<br> the cow calve?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―O, of course, Bantam spots the drink first thing!</span> said Mr
<span class="tag lineNumber">12400</span><br> O'Connor laughing.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>―Is that the way you chaps canvass,</span> said Mr Lyons, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>and
<br> Crofton and I out in the cold and rain looking for votes?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Why, blast your soul,</span> said Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>I'd get more votes in

<span class="tag lineNumber">12405</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Open two bottles of stout, Jack,</span> said Mr O'Connor.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Old Jack</span>―How can I?</span> said the old man, when there's no corkscrew?
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Wait now, wait now!</span> said Mr Henchy, getting up quickly.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>Did you ever see this little trick?</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">He took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the
<span class="tag lineNumber">12410</span><br> fire, put them on the hob. Then he sat down again by the fire
<br> and took another drink from his bottle. Mr Lyons sat on the
<br> edge of the table, pushed his hat towards the nape of his neck
<br> and began to swing his legs.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>―</span>Which is my bottle? he asked.
<span class="tag lineNumber">12415</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―This lad</span>, said Mr Henchy.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the
<br> other bottle on the hob. He was silent for two reasons. The
<br> first reason, sufficient in itself, was that he had nothing to say;
<br> the second reason was that he considered his companions
<span class="tag lineNumber">12420</span><br> beneath him. He had been a canvasser for Wilkins, the con=
<br> servative, but, when the conservatives had withdrawn their
<br> man and, choosing the lesser of two evils, given their support
<br> to the nationalist candidate, he had been engaged to work for
<br> Mr Tierney.</p>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12425</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">In a few minutes an apologetic <span class="emph">Pok!</span> was heard as the cork
<br> flew out of Mr Lyons's bottle. Mr Lyons jumped off the table,
<br> went to the fire, took his bottle and carried it back to the table.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―I was just telling them, Crofton,</span> said Mr Henchy, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>that we
<br> got a good few votes today.</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12430</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>―</span>Who did you get? asked Mr Lyons.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Well, I got Parkes for one and I got Atkinson for two and I
<br> got Ward of Dawson Street. Fine old chap he is, too—regular
<br> old toff, old conservative! <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Ward?</span>But isn't your candidate a national=
    <br> ist?</span> said he. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>He's a respectable man</span>, said I. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>He's in favour of
<span class="tag lineNumber">12435</span><br> whatever will benefit this country. He's a big ratepayer</span>, I said.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>He has extensive house property in the city and three places of
<br> business and isn't it to his own advantage to keep down the
<br> rates? He's a prominent and respected citizen</span>, said I, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>and a
<br> Poor Law Guardian and he doesn't belong to any party, good
<span class="tag lineNumber">12440</span><br> bad or indifferent.</span> That's the way to talk to 'em.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>―And what about the address to the King?</span> said Mr Lyons,
<br> after drinking and smacking his lips.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Listen to me,</span> said Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>What we want in this
<br> country, as I said to old Ward, is capital. The King's coming
<span class="tag lineNumber">12445</span><br> here will mean an influx of money into this country. The
<br> citizens of Dublin will benefit by it. Look at all the factories
<br> down by the quays there, idle! Look at all the money there is in
<br> the country if we only worked the old industries, the mills, the
<br> shipbuilding yards and factories. It's capital we want.</span>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12450</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―But look here, John,</span> said Mr O'Connor. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>Why should we

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Parnell,</span> said Mr Henchy, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>is dead. Now, here's the way I
<br> look at it. Here's this chap come to the throne after his old
<br> mother keeping him out of it till the man was grey. He's a man
<span class="tag lineNumber">12455</span><br> of the world and he means well by us. He's a jolly fine decent
<br> fellow, if you ask me, and no damn nonsense about him. He
<br> just says to himself: <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">King Edward</span>The old one never went to see these wild
<br> Irish. By Christ, I'll go myself and see what they're like.</span> And
<br> are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a
<span class="tag lineNumber">12460</span><br> friendly visit? Eh? Isn't that right, Crofton?</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Crofton nodded his head.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>―But after all now,</span> said Mr Lyons argumentatively, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>King
<br> Edward's life, you know, is not the very .....</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―Let bygones be bygones,</span> said Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>I admire the man
<span class="tag lineNumber">12465</span><br> personally. He's just an ordinary knockabout like you and me.
<br> He's fond of his glass of grog and he's a bit of a rake, perhaps,
<br> and he's a good sportsman. Damn it, can't we Irish play fair?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>―That's all very fine,</span> said Mr Lyons. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>But look at the case of

<span class="tag lineNumber">12470</span><br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―In the name of God,</span> said Mr Henchy, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>where's the analogy

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>―What I mean,</span> said Mr Lyons, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Lyons</span>is we have our ideals. Why,
<br> now, would we welcome a man like that? Do you think now
<br> after what he did Parnell was a fit man to lead us? Do you
<span class="tag lineNumber">12475</span><br> think he was a man I'd like the lady who is now Mrs Lyons to
<br> know? And why, then, would we do it for Edward the Seventh?</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―This is Parnell's anniversary,</span> said Mr O'Connor, <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>and don't

<br> <p class="textParagraph"><span class="emph">Pok!</span> The tardy cork flew out of Mr Crofton's bottle. Mr

<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―O, aye!</span> said Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>Give us that. Did you ever hear

<span class="tag lineNumber">12510</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to
<br> which they were alluding but, after reflecting a while, he said:
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Hynes</span>―O, that thing is it .... Sure, that's old now.</span>
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Out with it, man!</span> said Mr O'Connor.

<span class="tag lineNumber">12515</span><br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Hynes hesitated a little longer. Then amid the silence he
<br> took off his hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to
<br> be rehearsing the piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he
<br> announced:</p>

<br> <h2 class="heading">The Death of Parnell</h2>
<span class="tag lineNumber">12520</span><br> <h2 class="heading">6th October 1891</h2>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">He cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite:</p>
<p class="lg">
<br> He is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead.
<br> O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe
<br> For he lies dead whom the fell gang
<span class="tag lineNumber">12525</span><br> Of modern hypocrites laid low.
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <br> He lies slain by the coward hounds
    <br> He raised to glory from the mire:
    <br> And Erin's hopes and Erin's dreams
    <br> Perish upon her monarch's pyre.
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <span class="tag lineNumber">12530</span><br> In palace, cabin or in cot
    <br> The Irish heart where'er it be
    <br> Is bowed with woe—for he is gone
    <br> Who would have wrought her destiny.
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <br> He would have had his Erin famed,
    <span class="tag lineNumber">12535</span><br> The green flag gloriously unfurled,
    <br> Her statesmen, bards and warriors raised
    <br> Before the nations of the world.
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <br> He dreamed (alas,'twas but a dream!)
    <br> Of Liberty: but as he strove
    <span class="tag lineNumber">12540</span><br> To clutch that idol, treachery
    <br> Sundered him from the thing he loved.
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <br> Shame on the coward caitiff hands
    <br> That smote their Lord or with a kiss
    <br> Betrayed him to the rabble-rout
    <span class="tag lineNumber">12545</span><br> Of fawning priests—no friends of his!
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <br> May everlasting shame consume
    <br> The memory of those who tried
    <br> To befoul and smear th' exalted name
    <br> Of one who spurned them in his pride!
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <span class="tag lineNumber">12550</span><br> He fell, as fall the mighty ones,
    <br> Nobly undaunted to the last,
    <br> And Death has now united him
    <br> With Erin's heroes of the past.
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <br> No sound of strife disturb his sleep!
    <span class="tag lineNumber">12555</span><br> Calmly he rests: no human pain
    <br> Or high ambition spurs him now
    <br> The peaks of glory to attain.
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <br> They had their way: they laid him low.
    <br> But Erin, list, his spirit may
    <span class="tag lineNumber">12560</span><br> Rise, like the Phoenix from the flames,
    <br> When breaks the dawning of the day,
</p>
<p class="lg">
    <br> The day that brings us Freedom's reign.
    <br> And on that day may Erin well
    <br> Pledge in the cup she lifts to Joy
    <span class="tag lineNumber">12565</span><br> One grief—the memory of Parnell.
</p>

<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Hynes sat down again on the table. When he had
<br> finished his recitation there was a silence and then a burst of
<br> clapping: even Mr Lyons clapped. The applause continued for
<br> a little time. When it had ceased all the auditors drank from
<span class="tag lineNumber">12570</span><br> their bottles in silence.</p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph"><span class="emph">Pok!</span> The cork flew out of Mr Hynes's bottle but Mr Hynes
<br> remained sitting, flushed and bareheaded on the table. He did
<br> not seem to have heard the invitation.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr O'Connor</span>―Good man, Joe!</span> said Mr O'Connor, taking out his cigarette
<span class="tag lineNumber">12575</span><br> papers and pouch the better to hide his emotion.
<br> <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>―What do you think of that, Crofton?</span> cried Mr Henchy. <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Henchy</span>Isn't
<br> that fine—what?</span></p>
<br> <p class="textParagraph">Mr Crofton said that <span class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Crofton</span>it was a very fine piece of writing.</span></p>
